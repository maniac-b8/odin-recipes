    <h1>Directions</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large, wide pot over medium-high 
            heat until oil begins to smoke. Sear lamb shanks in hot 
            oil on all sides until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove 
            lamb shanks and set aside. Drain excess grease.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add onion and garlic to the Dutch oven over medium heat. 
            Cook and stir until onion is softened and translucent,
             about 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, celery, and tomato paste; 
             cook for 5 minutes more.</p></li>
        <li><p>Return lamb shanks to the Dutch oven and pour in broth and stout beer. 
            Use kitchen twine to tie together thyme, parsley, and bay leaf into a 
            secure bundle; add to lamb shanks. Bring to a boil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 
            until lamb is tender and nearly falls off the bone, 2 to 3 hours. 
            Stir in rosemary sprig and season with salt and pepper during
             the last 10 minutes of cooking. Remove rosemary sprig 
             and herb bundle before serving.</p></li>         
      </ol>
